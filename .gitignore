# See http://help.github.com/ignore-files/ for more about ignoring files.
#
# If you find yourself ignoring temporary files generated by your text editor
# or operating system, you probably want to add a global ignore instead:
# git config --global core.excludesfile ~/.gitignore_global

.env

# Ignore bundler config
/.bundle

# Ignore the staging and calls directory
/staging
/calls

# Ignore cache
/.sass-cache
/.cache

# Ignore .DS_store file
.DS_Store

# for a library or gem, you might want to ignore these files since the code is
# intended to run in multiple environments; otherwise, check them in:
# Gemfile.lock
# .ruby-version
# .ruby-gemset
